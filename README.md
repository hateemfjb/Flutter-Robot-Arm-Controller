# Flutter-Robot-Arm-Controller
This mobile application was developed using Flutter to control a 4-DOF robotic arm. The user can adjust four motor values using sliders, save the current pose (motor positions) into a MySQL database, view all saved poses in a table, and execute or delete them. The backend is built using PHP, and the data is stored in MySQL using XAMPP.
